                              Huskies have a thick double coat that keeps them well insulated. 
                              Their undercoat is short and warm, while the overcoat is 
                              long and water-resistant. Their almond-shaped eyes allow them 
                              to squint to keep out snow.Husky is a general name for a sled-type of dog.

		         <p>The graceful, medium sized Siberian Husky almond-shaped eyes 
                             can be either brown or blue and sometimes one of each and convey a keen 
                              but amiable and even mischievous expression.
                              Quick and nimble-footed, Siberians are known for their powerful but seemingly effortless gait. 
                              Tipping the scales at no more than 60 pounds, they are noticeably smaller and lighter than their burly cousin, 
                              the Alaskan Malamute.
